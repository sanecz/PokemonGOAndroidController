Requires enabling mock location and Mock Mock Location from the Xposed framework to hide it to other apps.


How to use it:

- Set location (default 0.0 0.0)

- Start server


Curl on http://yourip:8080/lat_lon to move your GPS to this location. It's slow but you can modify it in the FakeGPS.py

I use it with a modified version of https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map
